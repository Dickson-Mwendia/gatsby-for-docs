# Fixing the navegation

The first thing that you will notice when test or recently deployed web (wow ðŸŽ‰), is that navigation didn't work, if you click in any link on the left menu you will get this page:

![page 404 in git](../doc-img/404-in-git.png)

It's self explanatory, the links are not correct ðŸ˜•, but why this happen? When we click in the second links for exmaple we get this in the browser `https://joolfe.github.io/02-setup-environment` and this page doesn't exist because the are a part missing in the path the repo name `gatsby-for-docs`, so the correct url should be `https://joolfe.github.io/gatsby-for-docs/02-setup-environment`.
After a ligth reading in the [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/#github-repository-page) we found that need to set up an the property `pathPrefix` in config, to say gatbsy that we are not deployed in the root path of the domain.

So just go to the file `config.js` and update the property with value `gatsby-for-docs`, build again, publish and done ðŸ’ª.
