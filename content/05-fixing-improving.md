# Fixing the navegation

The first thing that you will notice when test or recently deployed web (wow ðŸŽ‰), is that navigation didn't work, if you click in any link on the left menu you will get this page:

![page 404 in git](./doc-img/404-in-git.png)

It's self explanatory, the links are not correct ðŸ˜•, but why this happen? When we click in the second links for exmaple we get this in the browser `https://joolfe.github.io/02-setup-environment` and this page doesn't exist because the are a part missing in the path the repo name `gatsby-for-docs`, so the correct url should be `https://joolfe.github.io/gatsby-for-docs/02-setup-environment`.
After a ligth reading in the [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/#github-repository-page) we found that need to set up an the property `pathPrefix` in config, to say gatbsy that we are not deployed in the root path of the domain.

So just go to the file `config.js` and update the property with value `gatsby-for-docs`, build again, publish and done ðŸ’ª.

# Images

Other problem that we can see at a glance is that images are not being loaded in our tutorial ðŸ˜ž

![image not load](./doc-img/no-image.png)

If we test in local in the develop server we can see that images are not loaded ðŸ˜®, so should be the way that we are referencing images or where images are located.

Right now we have images in a folder called `/doc-img` in the root and we are referencing images from markdown using this code`![image not load](../doc-img/no-image.png)`.
