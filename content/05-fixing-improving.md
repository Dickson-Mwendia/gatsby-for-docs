# Fixing the navegation

The first thing that you will notice when test or recently deployed web (wow ðŸŽ‰), is that navigation didn't work, if you click in any link on the left menu you will get this page:

![page 404 in git](./doc-img/404-in-git.png)

It's self explanatory, the links are not correct ðŸ˜•, but why this happen? When we click in the second links for exmaple we get this in the browser `https://joolfe.github.io/02-setup-environment` and this page doesn't exist because the are a part missing in the path the repo name `gatsby-for-docs`, so the correct url should be `https://joolfe.github.io/gatsby-for-docs/02-setup-environment`.
After a ligth reading in the [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/#github-repository-page) we found that need to set up an the property `pathPrefix` in config, to say gatbsy that we are not deployed in the root path of the domain.

So just go to the file `config.js` and update the property with value `gatsby-for-docs`, build again, publish and done ðŸ’ª.

# Images

Other problem that we can see at a glance is that images are not being loaded in our tutorial ðŸ˜ž

![image not load](./doc-img/no-image.png)

If we test in local in the develop server we can see that images are not loaded ðŸ˜®, so should be the way that we are referencing images or where images are located.

Right now we have images in a folder called `/doc-img` in root project level and we are referencing images from markdown using this code `![image not load](../doc-img/no-image.png)`.

I have found nothing related with images in the  [gatsby-gitbook-starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/hasura/gatsby-gitbook-starter/) git repo or docs but to make builder understand that should take the images i think we should put inside the `/content` folder, here is where we are putting all our static content ðŸ˜š. 

So we move our images to `/content/doc-img/` folder and in our markdown we are going to reference images as `![image not load](./doc-img/no-image.png)` (we just remove a point ðŸ˜‰). 

Now we should test in local so:

```
$ gatsby develop
```

and when we go to `http://http://localhost:8000` we can confirm that images are being loaded, awesome!!

Now just build, push and done ðŸ‘Œ!

# Complete the metainformation

If we open `config.js` file we can see that there are lot of parameters that should be configured like
`title` or `githubUrl`, so this step is very easy just complete the info related with our site, as result we will have this:

```javascript
const config = {
	"gatsby": {
		"pathPrefix": "/gatsby-for-docs/",
		"siteUrl": "https://joolfe.github.io",
		"gaTrackingId": null
	},
	"header": {
		"logo": "https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/img/hasura_icon_white.svg",
		"title": "Gatsby gitbook tutorial",
		"githubUrl": "https://github.com/joolfe/gatsby-for-docs",
		"helpUrl": "",
		"tweetText": "",
		"links": [{ "text": "", "link": ""}],
	},
	"sidebar": {
		"forcedNavOrder": [],
		"links": [{ "text": "", "link": ""}]
	},
	"siteMetadata": {
		"title": "Gatsby gitbook tutorial",
		"description": "Step by step tutorial about how to use gatsby to create a gitbook doc.",
		"ogImage": null,
		"docsLocation": "https://github.com/joolfe/gatsby-for-docs/tree/master/content",
		"favicon": "https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/img/hasura_icon_black.svg"
	},
};

module.exports = config;
```

ðŸ‘‰ We will change the logo url soon...

# Ups build files are collisioning!

Remove doc folder content before build.

# Urls 

The url of our page are not pretty.

# Right index 

Only first level is showed not sure if we should change for put second level also??

# Index page
