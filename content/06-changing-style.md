# Color theme

Its time to put our webpage prettier, I don't have problems with the purple color üçÜ, but I think is not our style...

I love the blue color but all my web start being almost the same so let us try something different, what if we search in google about the "color of the year"? 

![color of the year in google](doc-img/color-of-the-year.png)

üòµ WOW, this thing exits hahaha, ok so let us use the color of the year that is "Living Coral" as our inspiration.

When I work in themes, I like to first generate a color palette, I'm not too strict with colors but just to have a base to work with. An online tool that I like a lot is [coolors](https://coolors.co/) because it is an easy way to generate random palette and adjust to your likes.

We start in the first column putting our coral `#FF4040` and "locking" the color, then clicking on the space bar and colors start to change, after did this process some times we get this:

![collor pallete](doc-img/color-pallete.png)

> This is the link of [our final palette](https://coolors.co/ff4040-eeeeee-dadad9-36382e-5bc3eb) as colors are in the URL you can share or save very quickly, isn't amazing? üåà



# Changing primary color

Our primary color then is going to be the coral `#FF4040`, so our header must have this color. To see where is the color defined let us use the [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en), so just right click on the header 

![header color using devtool](doc-img/header-color-devtools.png)

And we can see that header `background-color` comes from CSS class `navBarDefault`, if we search for this inside the `/src` folder we will find that this CSS class is located into `src/components/styles.css` file, so let us just change it üòå.

> We are going to follow this process to find out all the CSS classes that we need to change, so we are not going to describe this process anymore üòâ.

Gatsby develop server comes with "hot reload" so change sin CSS files will be updated automatically in the browser, in our case we see:

![header color change](doc-img/header-color-change.png)

Cool!



# Left menu color

In the case of the left menu I think also put a coral solor is not our style, I prefer something that makes the tutorial more readable, maybe the second color in our palette `#EEE`.

In this case, if we use DevTools we see a strange CSS class called `css-1h18y8r` umm more than sure these numbers mean that is a "compiled" style, and we confirm when try to search in the `src` file because got 0 results...

Well, we cannot forget that we are using gatsby and react so this should be because the style is inside the component. Just having a look to the `src/component` folder we see a `sidebar.js` file and in the code we can see some CSS code:

```jsx
const Sidebar = styled('aside')`
 width: 100%;
 /* background-color: rgb(245, 247, 249); */
 /* border-right: 1px solid #ede7f3; */
 height: 100vh;
 overflow: auto;
 position: fixed;
 padding-left: 24px;
 position: -webkit-sticky;
 position: -moz-sticky;
 position: sticky;
 top: 0;
 padding-right: 0;
 background-color: #372476;
 /* Safari 4-5, Chrome 1-9 */
 background: linear-gradient(#372476, #3b173b);
 background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 0%, 0% 100%, from(#372476), to(#3b173b));
 /* Safari 5.1, Chrome 10+ */
 background: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, #372476, #3b173b);
 /* Firefox 3.6+ */
 background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #372476, #3b173b);
 /* IE 10 */
 background: -ms-linear-gradient(top, #372476, #3b173b);
 /* Opera 11.10+ */
```

The background is defined using a `background-color` but also there are gradients using `background`, in our case we want just a plain color so just add our color and remove the rest, I mean to put this `background-color: #EEE` and just after the change we get in browser this:

![color nav bar](doc-img/color-nav-bar.png)

üò£ umm colors of the fonts are not working with the new background, let us fix this and put the same color that we are using in the rest of the text `#3b454e`, to change menu text color just in the same file `src/component/sidebar.js` a little below in the code there is the CSS definition for links.

![nav bar fonts color](doc-img/nav-bar-fonts-color.png)

Better now, but still this purple color when the link is `active`, this is the code for this case:

```jsx
 ${props =>
 props.active &&
 `
 color: #fff;
 background-color: #473485;
 `} // external link icon
```

We should remove the `background-color` and I'm going to use the primary color for the emphasis so we put `color: #FF4040`, this is the result:

![nav bar fonts color activate](doc-img/nav-bar-fonts-color-active.png)

Pretty isn't it? But wait! when we put the cursor on top of the menu options the purple color appears again üò†, this is because we forget to change the `hover` CSS directive, we are going to use our third color `#DADAD9` and this is the final result:

![nav bar fonts color hover](doc-img/nav-bar-fonts-color-hover.png)

How much beauty üò¢.



# Rest of the colors...

We have changed most visible color elements but there are other elements that still has the purple color,
- Links `<a>` (CSS in `src/template/docs.js`)
- Links in the right menu on hover (CSS in `src/comonents/rightSidebar.js`)
- Line near to the page title (CSS in `src/components/styles.css`)
- Navigation buttons in the bottom of the page (CSS in `src/components/styles.css`)

I'm not going to repeat the steps here, we just look for CSS classes using devtools and change the value in the static CSS file or dynamic classes inside components code. All this color will be replaced by our wonderfull primary color `#FF4040` and also for add a little contrast, we are going to use our secondary color `#5BC3EB` in inline code blocks, actually has this look

![inline code before](doc-img/inline-code-before.png)

And after change the css in `sr/components/mdxComponents` (basically adding `color: #5BC3EB;`) we obtain this:

![inline code after](doc-img/inline-code-after.png)

Cool! ü§ò



# Image borders

Some images in our tutorial don't look pretty well, like for example this one:

![images no border](doc-img/images-no-border.png)

If you look carefully the GitHub form is a picture but seems part of our text üò©, to avoid this effect we are going to put a border around images, and for maintaining the style coherence we are going to use the same border that already exists in our code blocks.

We just do right click in a code block and inspect the css, the trick to do the border is very elegant, just use:

```css
 background-color: #f5f7f9;
 padding: 9.5px;
 border-radius: 4px;
```

So we can add into the `src/componenets/styles.css` file a new css rule to make all images that are inside the main body (we don't want to put a border to the logo for example üòó) have the border, this code should work:

```css
.mainWrapper img {
 background-color: #f5f7f9;
 padding: 9.5px;
 border-radius: 4px; 
}
```
If we refresh in local we will see this:

![images with borders](doc-img/images-with-border.png)

Awesome! üí™



# Quote panels

Other piece that we can improve are the Quote panels, I mean elements that appear when we use in markdown a quote like this:

```md
> Hi! this is a quote :-)
```

In our tutorial has this style

![Quote before change](doc-img/quote-before-change.png)

Too much discreet for my taste, so let us put some of color to this panel, I think we can use our blue color as inspiration `#5BC3EB`, also add some background and fix the spacing of the component.

So we add this code into `src/componenets/styles.css` file:

```css
blockquote {
 padding: 20px;
 font-size: 14.5px;
 border-left: 5px solid #5BC3EB;
 background-color: #f5f7f9;
 color: #6b747b;
}

blockquote p:first-child{
 margin-top: 0px;
}
```

If we test in local we can see this

![img](doc-img/quote-after-changes.png)



# Logo

We are going to add our custom logo to the web üòä, because we are "experimenting" with **gatsby** I have think in merge the concept of experiment and gatsby, for experiment I have think something like a test tube and for gatsby just the logo, so the result is this:

![new logo](doc-img/new-logo-2.png)

I know, I know... I'm not a designer üòù... but this should work... ff you remember while setting up the meta we see a **logo** property inside `config.js` file, concretely in header section that looks like:

```json
    "header": {
        "logo": "https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/img/hasura_icon_white.sv",
        "title": "Gatsby gitbook tutorial",
        "githubUrl": "https://github.com/joolfe/gatsby-for-docs",
        "helpUrl": "",
        "tweetText": "",
        "links": [{ "text": "", "link": ""}],
    }
```

Ummm... but this logo is an outside resource... we want to use a logo in **svg** format and the resource will be inside our files üòï. Let's have a look to the code that print the logo (remeber using DevTool...), we get this:

```html
<a aria-current="page" class="navbar-brand navBarBrand" href="/gatsby-for-docs/">
 <img class="img-responsive" src="https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/img/hasura_icon_white.svg" alt="logo">
 Gatsby gitbook tutorial
</a>
```

So we search in our files for the CSS class `navbar-brand navBarBrand`, we easily find that is inside file `src/components/Header.js`, ok makes sense hehehe. The code that print the logo is this one:

```jsx
 <Link to="/" className={'navbar-brand navBarBrand'}>
 {logo !== '' ?
 (<img className={'img-responsive'} src={logo} alt={'logo'} />)
 :
 (<img className={'img-responsive'} src={logoImg} alt={'logo'} />)
 }
 {headerTitle}
 </Link>
```

Is very easy to understand, if in the config we have the **logo** parameter filled then this value is used, if not then use `{logoImg}`, just in same file a little early we found the definition of this variable `const logoImg = require('./images/logo.svg');`, so basically is using a static resource inside folder `src/images`, that's great because is exactly what we need üòè.

So to use our logo we just copy our SVG image into `src/images` folder and put an empty value for **logo** field in `config.js` file. Time to test in local with `$ gatsby develop` and go to the browser to found:

![new logo in web](doc-img/new-logo-web.png)

Wow our logo is there, but... for my taste is very small and is too near to left side, we can adjust this with some css code inside `src/components/style.css` like this:

```css
.navBarBrand img {
 width: 50px;
 margin-right: 10px;
 margin-left: 30px;
 display: inline-block;
}
```

And the result is just perfect üòÉ
